Kinect3DPrinter
===============

Takes the depth image from a Kinect 2 sensor and creates an STL object for 3D printing.

You can set the near and far planes to clip the depth image and also the width and height of the object that is to be produced.

The STL file can be loaded into any slicing program that you fancy (I use Cura) and used to produce interesting prints.
